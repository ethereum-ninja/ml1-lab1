In a normal regression model, a zero imputation might be useful because it would remove the effect of this feature. We could also include a dummy variable to indicate if this feature is missing, which would help us tell if the model gains infomation from knowing there are no reviews.\n",

It does not make sense to impute these. We have host_id, with no missing, to identify unique hosts. In most cases that would make name and host_name redundant. If for some reason we do need them, we could try to repair them by checking if that host has any other listings with those variables populated, using host_id.

    "Previously we showed the 99th percentile for proce to be around $800 a night. The listings above far exceed that, some by more than 10x. From the descriptions, these seem to be luxury spaces, event spaces, longer term leases, or mistakes. A google search showed rooms at the 5 star Four Seasons hotel to be going for around $1100, which helps make the case that these rooms are above and beyond the usual accommodations. These would likely not be of interest to your average tourist, we may consider excluding listings above $800 a night based on the 99th percentile. We might consider the same treatment on the low end, where some rooms are listed for $0. Again these appear to actual listings but likely have special circumstances that would not be interesting to your average tourist. We can also search for a way to exclude lease style listings."
