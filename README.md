- pip install pipenv if you haven't already
- run pipenv install from the terminal and all dependencies will be resolved by pipenv

### Classification Problem

- Predict Room Type :
    * Private Room 
    * Entire home/apt
    * Shared room (drop shared room)
    
#### Regression 
    * Same features
    * Invert to predict price (clean outliers)

• Business Understanding (10 points total).
    
• Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why was this data collected in
the first place?). Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the
dataset. That is, why is this data important and how do you know if you have mined
useful knowledge from the dataset? How would you measure the effectiveness of a
good prediction algorithm? Be specific
   
   # WILL
   
• Data Understanding (80 points total)

• [10 points] Describe the meaning and type of data (scale, values, etc.) for each
attribute in the data file.
  # STEVE
• [15 points] Verify data quality: Explain any missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
Are those mistakes? How do you deal with these problems? Be specific.
    # WILL

• [10 points] Give simple, appropriate statistics (range, mode, mean, median, variance,
counts, etc.) for the most important attributes and describe what they mean or if you
found something interesting. Note: You can also use data from other sources for
comparison. Explain the significance of the statistics run and why they are meaningful.
  # TAZEB
• [15 points] Visualize the most important attributes appropriately (at least 5 attributes).
Important: Provide an interpretation for each chart. Explain for each attribute why the
chosen visualization is appropriate.
 # TAZEB
• [15 points] Explore relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes via scatter
plots, correlation, cross-tabulation, group-wise averages, etc. as appropriate. Explain
any interesting relationships.
  # SEAN
• [10 points] Identify and explain interesting relationships between features and the class
you are trying to predict (i.e., relationships with variables and the target classification).
  # SEAN
• [5 points] Are there other features that could be added to the data or created from
existing features? Which ones?
   # STEVE
• Exceptional Work (10 points total)
  # STEVE

• You have free reign to provide additional analyses.

• One idea: implement dimensionality reduction, then visualize and interpret the results.
