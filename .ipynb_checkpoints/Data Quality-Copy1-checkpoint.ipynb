In a normal regression model, a zero imputation might be useful because it would remove the effect of this feature. We could also include a dummy variable to indicate if this feature is missing, which would help us tell if the model gains infomation from knowing there are no reviews.\n",

It does not make sense to impute these. We have host_id, with no missing, to identify unique hosts. In most cases that would make name and host_name redundant. If for some reason we do need them, we could try to repair them by checking if that host has any other listings with those variables populated, using host_id.
